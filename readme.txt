Re-visiting the root index.html file after starting an exam SOMETIMES disrupts the localstorage. Often, the localstorage does work as expected.

As a workaround, to switch from the admin account to a student account, kindly visit the /login/index.html file.

Files for use with the initializer page are located in /res
